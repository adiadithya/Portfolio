### About me **üëã**

Hi, my name is **Adithya**. Since the beginning of 2021, I have been studying and practicing to become a **QA Tester**. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself.

In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my **practical skills** that I have gained through **courses, self-study, and my job**. I am determined to continue growing in this field.

I have also started learning **test automation**, so at the moment, my main focus is on **furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area**.
